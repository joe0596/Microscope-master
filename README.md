# Microscope
Microscope is a simulation of a microscope.

### Code Concept
The code architecture is based off of scenes and scene tasks. Scenes are phases of the simulation (e.g. introduction, setup, free-mode). Scene tasks are objectives within a scene that the user must complete. When all the objectives within a scene are complete, the scene ends and advances to the next scene.
