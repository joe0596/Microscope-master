-Intro Notes-
1. Light Switch
2. Condenser:		y-axis diaphragm— should always be at the top

-Tutorial Notes-
red lens	
	aperture lowest good

initial state:	
	- light off
	- stage down
	- condenser down
	- slide off
	- lens that is not red

low mag/high mag->low/medium/high

**calibrate views
** overexposure
__ aperture- start closed

	> turn on light
	> condenser up— scale
	> slide on
	> caliper (x, y)
--- end set up

	> lenses- lowmag

	** cannot set diopter on low mag **
	yellow:

- Game/Quiz Design - 
* Sorted by priority
	[]Total magnification (1)
		Question that pops up where user identifies the total
		magnification (10*current objective)
	[]Cell count (2)
		-Under 40X (where cells are large enough to count)
		-Put 12-15 cells.
		-Choose image and contact marvin for count.
	[]Clean scope (3)
		> lens paper / windex
		1. Take lens paper. 
		2. apply windex to paper. 
		3. then wipe ocular lens in a circular motion, objectives, aperture light emitter, slide, and top of condensor.
	[]Watch video and identify what person does wrong (4).

— Meetings/Discussions/Backlogs- 

10/17/16
Feedback:

[x]When y caliper moves down, everything on the view gets realistically bigger (scale x/y, slide down).
[x]Create a side view of the scope and put it at the side of the front[]view so there are two views active simultaneously.
[x]Create 8 SVG views of the lenses. 4 for fixed pivots, 4 for intermission pivots. Add drag functionality at top of lense (Warning to not touch lenses)
    [x]Modify SVG files to represent orientation of the scope better.
[x]Modify setup stage to include:
    [x]Place slide in.
    [x]Toggle aperture light.
    [x]Control calipers to make sure specimen is under the aperture light (Perhaps popup view to show specimen orientation). 
[x]Aperture knob light should increase as magnification increases
    [x]Low mag should have very low light.
    [x]High mag should have higher aperture value (more diffraction).
    [x]Change orientation of aperture knob to rightmost side.
[x]Utilize bindings over setTimeout if possible.
[x]Slide view should change by state changes. 

10/28/16
[x]Debug the circular motion of the side view
[x]Attach side view to mag view so they update synchronously
[x]Coarse knob needs to moderately zoom on slide
[x]Fine knob needs to blur/unblur the slide
[x]Make a middleware function between animations to translate pixel to percentage values
[x]"Learning the Ropes" should be renamed to low mag
[x]Turn old low mag into high mag scene.
[x]Debugger should destroy highlights
[x]Can we make it so that the clone blurs move with the main objects.


11/2/16
[]Email: meilin.chan@stonybrook.edu
[x]Give better feedback on the slide contents (Setup)
[]Arrows to indicate.. Might be excessive, just inline[]text of telling user to click might work.
[]Issue of sequential steps.
[]Try to make operations of drag smoother.


-- !!!RECENT!!! Backlog (Since January 27) --
[x]Fine tuning values of microcsope to be as realistic as possible
[x]Responsive design when reduced
[x]Aperture precision not implemented yet.
[x]Slide content container must adjust to window changes.
    [x]Fix responsive design
    [x]Find magic numbers to ensure alignment with calipers.
[x]Readjust position of popup as it goes step by step
[x]Play with the possibility of moving the guiding text over to the side steps (toggability).
[x]Overflow x on popup box.
[x]Create a large text box below (or above) the steps to detail a particular steps (descriptions)
[x]Modify header to extend use such as: returning to "Intro" scene, switching modes, etc.
[x]Should only be one difficulty regarding how the microscope is being used.
[x]Adjust slide so that it triggers its activation on top of pseudoclone.
[x]Implement game modes (restriction to restrictionless)
[x]Rewrite the popup text (directions) to be more brief.
[x]Difficulty/Quizzing are the "Games" were are implenting.
[x]Unneeded completion feedback when doing Tutorial (start).
[x]Need completion feedback when doing Tutorial (end)
[x]Deviate from framework and add a feedback button before moving forward.
[x]Modify scenes/setup.js caliper positions to calibrate where x,y = 0,0. 
[xxxxxxxxxx THE DEMON IS GONE]Rotation not firefox compatible. (Sharin needs to look at the svg/ai file and confirm this and next backlog)
[x]Modify Coarse Knob to complete on clarity (white line).
[x] Currently the sideview knob is unresponsive


[x]Occasional bug arises where nothing loads. Test by refreshing && disabling cache.
    [x]resize line 17X? - solved using try/catch... 
[]Track State machine
    []Model 1: persistent frame that updates between steps. (Model 1 is ordered)
    []Model 2: multiple frames that checks each step in a scene (Model 2 is unordered) 
    []Ensure "unsupervised" actions don't leave game unprogressable
    []Moving lenses (with resets the blur), coarse gets stuck and fine inactive

[]Add warnings/additional text
    []Too high of aperture light will be blinding (on low mag)
    []Too far movement of knobs may blur view. 

- 2/16/2017 Meeting (New Backlog)- 
[x] For low mag change description text to "rotate the lenses to the lowest objective (4X) without the 100X objective passing the slide." 
	[x]Reflect these changes on med, and high mag.
[x] For warning on 100x change text to "Stop! You risk damaging the 100X objective by moving passed the slide. Go the other way."
[x] Diopter side drag (not vertical drag) trigger up/down motion
[x] Add coarse knob step back to Medium magnification. 
[x] Fix debugger
[x] Cleaning up (Extra steps) 
	[x]Rotate to 4X
	[x]using coarse focus drop the stage all the way down
	[x]remove the slide
	[x]turn off the light.

[x] Slide placement drag by white piece when placing into calipers
[x] Slide holder pull to place (click or drag to pull), animate.
[x] fix the lenses functionality.
[x] Slide view contents more reflective IRL:
	[x] Rectangular image, enlarge. 
	[x] On farend (bounds of caliper), show slide edge
	[x] On uncalibrated, show gray. 
[x] White label on slide
[] "(see details)" on instruction tooltip for clarity if extra details necessary to proceed.  
[] Once at 40X, coarse knob should trigger warning (may damage slide)
	****If they touch coarse focus on 40X, trigger large warning.



-Shrn delegation-
[xx] Make the coarse and fine knobs bigger (keep blue spacing minimal).
[x] The three different mags should have 3 different images (4X, 10X, 40X).
[!!] Draw box to hold slide.
[x] Diopter knob id, instead of entire diopter

!!- .svg export reminder-!!
check classes in css (.st)
when making changes to svg directly, do not save or export but use save as and change Font Type to Embed and CSS Properties (CSS -> Style Attributes)

- Tutorial Wish list (Extra) -
-Sideview motions and lenses to reflect the frontview
	-Objective lenses change on rotate.
	-Consider functionality on light switch/ coarse/fine knob drag 
-Leave glasses for clear vision.
-Slide break animation if coarse knob pushed up during (40X).
	-(Slap user animation)

- Game/Quiz Wishlist (Optional)-
	[]Change Slide
		> rotate red (not through white)
		> lower stage
		> reduce light
		> remove slide
		> add new slide
			> caliper (x,y)
			> coarse
			> rotate medium
			> fine
			> rotate to high
			> open aperture
			> fine
	

	[]Troubleshooting (fix the scope)
	[] field of view (measuring)
		> low mag
			> place ruler
			> caliper
		> high mag
		
	[] depth of focus
	[] Orientation (e-slide)
