- Light Switch
  Is a variable switch with parameters (warm temperature ~ white). Color temperature should be neutral-- achieved by turning light switch ~all the way up~
  Users often turn the switch midway, resulting in an orange-tinted image. This makes the image difficult to see.
  => Implementation : CSS color overlay (#ff0000) with variable opacity. Probably logarithmic, not linear.


- Objective Lenses
  The objective lenses (white, blue, red, yellow) should not actually be touched. The rubber wheel should.
  => Implementation : Flash warning when lenses are clicked. Only rotating the wheel should move them.


- Objective Lenses
  Once the image is in focus, it is no longer necessary to adjust the coarse knob, only the fine knob.

- Objective Lenses
  The worst. Do not make the following transitions:
    Red -> White
    Blue -> White
unless the stage has been lowered. Otherwise, the glass of the white lens will make contact with the stage and break.
